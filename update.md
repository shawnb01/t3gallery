# Drizzle to Prisma Conversion Complete!

## What was changed:

1. Dependencies Updated:
   • Removed: drizzle-orm, drizzle-kit, eslint-plugin-drizzle
   • Added: @prisma/client, prisma
   • Updated package scripts to use Prisma commands (db:generate, db:push, db:studio)
2. Schema Conversion:
   • Removed drizzle.config.ts
   • Created prisma/schema.prisma with equivalent schema:
   ◦ PostgreSQL as the database provider
   ◦ Uses POSTGRES_URL environment variable
   ◦ Converted the images table to Prisma's Image model with proper mappings
   ◦ Maintained all field types, constraints, and indexes
3. Database Connection:
   • Replaced Drizzle's database connection in src/server/db/index.ts with Prisma Client
   • Added proper singleton pattern for Prisma Client (recommended for Next.js)
4. Query Conversion:
   • getMyImages(): Converted from Drizzle's db.query.images.findMany() to Prisma's db.image.findMany()
   • getImage(): Converted from Drizzle query syntax to Prisma's db.image.findFirst()
   • deleteImage(): Converted from Drizzle's delete syntax to Prisma's db.image.delete()
   • Upload functionality: Updated src/app/api/uploadthing/core.ts to use db.image.create()
5. Configuration Cleanup:
   • Removed Drizzle ESLint plugin and rules from .eslintrc.cjs
   • Removed unused imports and old schema files
   • Cleaned up any residual Drizzle directories

## Key Benefits of the Migration:

• Type Safety: Prisma provides excellent TypeScript integration with auto-generated types
• Better Developer Experience: Prisma Studio for database management and exploration
• Schema Management: Prisma's declarative schema approach with migrations
• Performance: Optimized queries and connection pooling
• Active Ecosystem: Large community and regular updates
